# Downloading the dataset from Kaggle

### Installing kaggle API


```python
# In order to be able to download datasets directly from the Kaggle 'repo'
# (instead of manually entering the site and downloading the required data),
# we need to install a python module called kaggle
# through pip package manager.
!pip install kaggle
```

### Generating kaggle API Token


```python
# we can see from the error above, that the API requires some authentication
# provided through a kaggle.json file in .kaggle directory.

# To get this file you will need to generate a Token from
# https://www.kaggle.com/settings site under the API section,
# pressing the 'Create New Token' button. 

# The generated Token will seems like this:
# {"username":"yourusername","key":"a32long-hashcode"}

# For example:
# {"username":"aderbal","key":"7b10681fbc3f1c5026d7cf01eb3139d8"}
```

### Trying to access datasets list from the API (again)


```python
# Now we will run the command to list the datasets,
# but with the needed authentication provided.
!kaggle datasets list
```

    Warning: Your Kaggle API key is readable by other users on this system! To fix this, you can run 'chmod 600 /home/jovyan/.kaggle/kaggle.json'
